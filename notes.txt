other logic from ref: don't include points too close, speed of vehicle etc.

everywhere in my code, the pose convention is : yzxrpy, and the yaw has to be -
for using in a transformation

still need to get permeabilities. need cpp code to make that good.

mat:

analyze taylor data:

brigthened image by contrast. how it works is a mystery to me.

scatter3 can handle about 1e5 points smoothly. keep matlab vegetation points at
max

vane sim:

there is a simple way of vizing the segments from each pcd, fill in the holes of
one pcd with the segmentation from another

manual segmentation, use coarse segmentation output from matlab.

grep todos in code

params:
min mahalanbois dist to consider intersection. 
the segment length of the ray plotting
the levels used for drawing ellipses

selection of scan ids to process. some smearing from nearest neighbour matches?

how to clean up code: put parameters in file and share them. 

need metric of comparison

what is the default value when nothing is returned from laser?
laser scanning pattern

names getting confusing 
scanPts, for the driveby
trainPts, makes sense

--------------------------------------------------

taylor data:

camera ids: clock-hour orientation, 12 is straight ahead

79: 10
80: 12
81: 4
82: 2
83: 8
84: 6

num frames:
38384, 38384, 6242, 6242, 6224, 7989

num velodyne packets: 4624457

--------------------------------------------------

cpp:

make big matrix of points and then transform?

while installing cloudcompare:

* installed qt5.7 via instructions from 
  https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
eventually files in ~ instead of /usr/local

* git cloned cloudcompare and followed instructions on BUILD.md

* used cmake gui to configure and generate. make of cloudcompare was not finding
  qt5.7

* changed qt default
http://askubuntu.com/questions/435564/qt5-installation-and-path-configuration

* this made it seem like 5.7 was being used, but compile still failed.

* in cmake gui, changed the qt root path + qt cmake refs to the directories in ~
which worked
