other logic from ref: don't include points too close, speed of vehicle etc.

everywhere in my code, the pose convention is : yzxrpy, and the yaw has to be -
for using in a transformation

still need to get permeabilities. need cpp code to make that good.

--------------------------------------------------

mat:

analyze taylor data:

brigthened image by contrast. how it works is a mystery to me.

scatter3 can handle about 1e5 points smoothly. keep matlab vegetation points at
max

vane sim:

there is a simple way of vizing the segments from each pcd, fill in the holes of
one pcd with the segmentation from another

manual segmentation, use coarse segmentation output from matlab.

grep todos in code

params:
viz:
segment length in plot
levels in plotting ellipse

sortintersectionflag used by mesh and ellipse, might want to change comments

selection of scan ids to process

metric of comparing point clouds

what is the default value when nothing is returned from laser?
laser scanning pattern

names getting confusing 
scanPts, for the driveby
trainPts, makes sense

triangulation requires some work of calculating isosurfaces, followed by
marching cubes. if only doing surface calculation for ground, then probably
enough to manually specify triangles.

maybe instead of making cell braces inside a long function, write subfunctions.

actually, perm value is opacity.

70% of ellipsoids scan rays hit
75% of tri scan rays hit

segment:

too many points for matlab to deal with. remember that values of params depend
on point cloud density, e.g. max dist to nbrs or min nbrs

--------------------------------------------------

taylor data:

camera ids: clock-hour orientation, 12 is straight ahead

79: 10
80: 12
81: 4
82: 2
83: 8
84: 6

num frames:
38384, 38384, 6242, 6242, 6224, 7989

num velodyne packets: 4624457

--------------------------------------------------

cpp:

vtk:
axes ticks
how does the gui mouse click work?

just like you have functions written in matlab for matlab processing, you need
to write emacs lisp to do simple operations in emacs

clustering:
get driveby poses and pts
scan ids to process
perm calc
multiple poses
viz side by side

cpp:
hierarchical clustering
pdist2
flann, nearest neighbors
auto( v : y )
std generator
why template only in header
auto
vector to eigen, vector to flann, better than copying
for each, lambdas
can make a bunch of things const &
many members are public

flann has hierarchical clustering also
check perm logic
clustering class
how to set which coords are in view
cpp slower than matlab, perhaps because copying vectors?
libgp slow. takes forever to fit to rim stretch ground train pts
alglib rbf fit also very slow.
matlab pdist2 very fast compared to for looping cpp

for rim stretch ground train, with 1e6 pts, takes 729 s with rbfdist = 1, level = 1, smoothness = 1e-3
10s with radius = 0.1m.

how does matlab manage griddata fast? probably does it only for query points

cluster_trial should be a class
better vizer logic

params:

while installing cloudcompare:

* installed qt5.7 via instructions from 
  https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
eventually files in ~ instead of /usr/local

* git cloned cloudcompare and followed instructions on BUILD.md

* used cmake gui to configure and generate. make of cloudcompare was not finding
  qt5.7

* changed qt default
http://askubuntu.com/questions/435564/qt5-installation-and-path-configuration

* this made it seem like 5.7 was being used, but compile still failed.

* in cmake gui, changed the qt root path + qt cmake refs to the directories in ~
which worked
