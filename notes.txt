other logic from ref: don't include points too close, speed of vehicle etc.

everywhere in my code, the pose convention is : yzxrpy, and the yaw has to be -
for using in a transformation

mat:

brigthened image by contrast. how it works is a mystery to me.

scatter3 can handle about 1e5 points smoothly. keep matlab vegetation points at max

fix pose extraction

there is a simple way of vizing the segments from each pcd, fill in the holes of
one pcd with the segmentation from another

manual segmentation can use coarse segmentation output from matlab.

don't plot clusters with less than some number of points

cpp:

make big matrix of points and then transform?

while installing cloudcompare:

* installed qt5.7 via instructions from 
  https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
eventually files in ~ instead of /usr/local

* git cloned cloudcompare and followed instructions on BUILD.md

* used cmake gui to configure and generate. make of cloudcompare was not finding
  qt5.7

* changed qt default
http://askubuntu.com/questions/435564/qt5-installation-and-path-configuration

* this made it seem like 5.7 was being used, but compile still failed.

* in cmake gui, changed the qt root path + qt cmake refs to the directories in ~
which worked
