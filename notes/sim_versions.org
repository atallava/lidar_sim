    - pts per cluster, max maha dist selected by sim optim
  - 070917
    - pts per cluster selected by slice sim optim, only on packet mean
      error. maha dist selected arbitrarily as 3. clustering is now with flann
    - sim section 8 takes 2hrs

    - this was the isrr submission version
    - the models are lost, but they can be recreated with old params, which are
      documented

    - with models from 250417 sec3, and ground-corrected transforms
  - 080917
    - with models from section 3 070917. and obb-matched primitive selection.
