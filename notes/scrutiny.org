- packet idx 1349
  - ray idx 318, 382, 383, 320
    - sim rays didn't penetrate vegetation
  - ray idx 30, 62, 64
    - sim hits but real doesn't. maybe not enough true miss information.
  - ray idx 247
    - ellipsoids too large, not transparent enough
- packet idx 2024
  - ray idx 128 256 368 305
    - false hit
  - ray idx 313 252
    - sim pt blocked early. i think stochastic.
  - ray idx 107 38
    - in dense vegetation, ray intersects a number of ellipsoids. max maha dist
      probably too large.
  - ray idx 272 267
    - good job penetrating through vegetation.
- packet idx 2699   
  overall looks like much larger variance than real data
  - ray idx 365 72
    - false hit. also ellipsoids very large.
  - ray idx 169 273 106
    - ellipsoids too large. gaussian samples have a high variance.
  - ray idx 172
    - good job in thicket. but got lucky in the high variance
- packet idx 3374
  - ray idx 369 225 289 323 76
    - false hit, from ground triangles. probably need better hit prob calc.
  - ray idx 195
    - good job. hitting ground :P
  - ray idx 343
    - hits too early. ellipsoids not transparent enough.
  - ray idx 211
    - false miss. no ground tri where there should of been
  - ray idx 313
    - the good job analogue of ray idx 343.
  - ray idx 378 188
    - false ellipsoid hit. embarassingly large variance.
  - ray idx 344
    - medium job. smaller variance could be better

* section id: 4. query type: slice. sim type: hg. version: 080917.
- packet idx 410. for many true hits, lower range than real. could be shape
  error, or not permeable enough. although the low precision makes me think too
  permeable?
  - ray idx 14
    - false hit. perhaps ellipsoids large variance. but otherwise sim looks to
      be doing job. unclear why real missed.
  - ray idx 98, 65
    - false miss. seems like a good case of not having enough ellipsoids at the
      right place. shape error. in this case, i should also be visualizing
      nearby annotations.
  - ray idx 149, 113
    - false hit. here sim hit some bushes farther down. again why real missed
      unclear.
  - ray idx 201, 176, 207
    - good job. how to present good job? that semantic segmented correctly, and
      then the primitive ellipsoids transferred over well?
  - ray idx 214
    - false hit. but this time on faraway ground.

- packet idx 37. ground packet. seems like a small ground patch was missed by
  ground tri modeling

- packet idx 695. overall looks like good job.
  - ray idx 208
    - good job. good example of simulating low shrub patch.
  - ray idx 210, 301
    - medium job.
  - ray idx 85, 213
    - large error. in shrub patch area, but sim got caught in early shrub, while
      real hit ground much later.
  - ray idx 130
    - false hit. but looks like ray pointing right at the ground, so real miss
      mysterious.
  - ray idx 240
    - false hit. sim hits far shrubs, while ground misses. seems like opposite
      of 85.

- packet idx 159
  - ray idx 20, 19
    - large error. in shrub patch area, but sim got caught in early shrub, while
      real hit ground much later.
  - ray idx 63, 384, 153, 89
    - false hit. sim hits a tree. bad annotation?
  - ray idx 65
    - false hit. but looks like ray pointing right at the ground, so why real miss?
  - ray idx 263, 359
    - good job. but ground, so no credit.

- packet idx 581. another veg seems to generate sim hits for which real wasn't
  present.

- packet idx 219. seems like good job with some low shrubs. but extraneous
  bigger ellipsoids are there?
  - ray idx 106
    - large error. sim hits early ell, real hits perhaps ground.
  - ray idx 338, 291, 301, 20, 49, 368
    - false hit. also large-ish variance. ray in thicket, so why real miss?
  - ray idx 126, 61
    - false hit. extraneous ellipsoids?
  - ray idx 313, 243, 107
    - good job. hits veg. so was the shape off which gave extraneous
      ell?

- packet idx 563. should be interesting because real and sim hit veg. so shape,
  anno etc can factor in. good shape overall.
  - ray idx 252
    - medium job. perhaps shape not exact match etc.
  - ray idx 286, 343, 58, 219
    - medium job. both hit tree. i think there might be ellipsoids shape issue,
      which prevents good job.

- packet idx 9. good shape test
  - ray idx 120, 88, 59, 56
    - false hit. sim hits far ell. why does real miss, check anno, primitives.
  - ray idx 207, 328, 142, 300, 362
    - false miss. too permeable ell?
  - ray idx 17
    - false hit. seems like opposite of earlier.
  - ray idx 100, 70, 
    - false hit. seems like opposite of 207. the two together might be a good
      candidate for stochasticity
  - ray idx 212
    - good job. hit shrub patch.
  - ray idx 155, 93, 91
    - good job. hit far ell, very nice
  - ray idx 250
    - false hit. opp of 155.

- packet idx 654. good shape test
  - ray idx 187
    - large error. real nearer than sim. some ellipsoids shape mismatch perhaps.
  - ray idx 172, 196, 100, 232
    - false miss. stochastic?
  - ray idx 314, 337
    - false hit. sim hits far veg.
  - ray idx 248
    - large error. shape mismatch?
  - ray idx 135
    - large error. sim nearer due to some shrubs.
  - ray idx 240, 80
    - good job.
  - ray idx 181, 87
    - good job. shrubs.
  - ray idx 120
    - large error. sim nearer than real. doesn't seem like ellipsoids near real?
  - ray idx 166
    - large error. sim nearer. shrubs
  - ray idx 169
    - medium job. same situation as 166. large ell variance?
  - ray idx 86
    - large error. in shrubs. large ell variance?

- packet idx 209
  - ray idx 163, 33, 308, 370, 38, 129, 12
    - false hit. ray passes through shrub patch. why does real miss?
  - ray idx 357, 201, 269
    - large error. true hit version of 163?
  - ray idx 261, 275
    - medium error. version of 357.
  - ray idx 238
    - good job.
  - ray idx 278
    - medium job. so was the shrub overdone?

- packet idx 122. one veg in sight

    - good job. hit far veg.
  - ray idx 21, 122

  - ray idx 211
    - large error. lost in shrubs.
  - ray idx 161
    - good job. in shrubs. stochastic.
  - ray idx

    - false hit. 
  - ray idx 267, 169, 172
    - good job. low shrub patch.

  - ray idx 195
    - good job.

    - false hit. why?
  - ray idx 313, 49, 308, 305, 261
    - good job. in tree.
