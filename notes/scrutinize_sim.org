- packet idx 1349
  - ray idx 318, 382, 383, 320
    - sim rays didn't penetrate vegetation
  - ray idx 30, 62, 64
    - sim hits but real doesn't. maybe not enough true miss information.
  - ray idx 247
    - ellipsoids too large, not transparent enough
- packet idx 2024
  - ray idx 128 256 368 305
    - false hit
  - ray idx 313 252
    - sim pt blocked early. i think stochastic.
  - ray idx 107 38
    - in dense vegetation, ray intersects a number of ellipsoids. max maha dist
      probably too large.
  - ray idx 272 267
    - good job penetrating through vegetation.
- packet idx 2699   
  overall looks like much larger variance than real data
  - ray idx 365 72
    - false hit. also ellipsoids very large.
  - ray idx 169 273 106
    - ellipsoids too large. gaussian samples have a high variance.
  - ray idx 172
    - good job in thicket. but got lucky in the high variance
- packet idx 3374
  - ray idx 369 225 289 323 76
    - false hit, from ground triangles. probably need better hit prob calc.
  - ray idx 195
    - good job. hitting ground :P
  - ray idx 343
    - hits too early. ellipsoids not transparent enough.
  - ray idx 211
    - false miss. no ground tri where there should of been
  - ray idx 313
    - the good job analogue of ray idx 343.
  - ray idx 378 188
    - false ellipsoid hit. embarassingly large variance.
  - ray idx 344
    - medium job. smaller variance could be better
