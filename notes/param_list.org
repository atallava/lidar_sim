- TriangleModeler
  - m_max_pts_for_surface
    used in subsampling
  - m_max_triangle_side
    used to filter large triangles
  - alglib stuff for fitting smooth surface
    - m_rbf_radius
    - m_rbf_layers
    - m_rbf_reg
  - generating and cutting nodes
    - m_fit_pts_padding
    - m_fit_node_resn
    - m_max_dist_to_projn
  - hit prob stuff
    - m_hit_count_prior
    - m_miss_count_prior
    - m_default_hit_prob

- TriangleModelSim
  - m_range_var
    should ideally come from data
  - m_max_residual for hit
    this gets used in hit prob calc

- EllipsoidModeler
  - m_n_clusters_per_pt 
    this is cluster density. this goes into optimization, but needs upper and lower bounds
  - m_min_pts_per_cluster
    this could be higher? not sure this should go into optimization
  - hit prob stuff
    - m_hit_count_prior
    - m_miss_count_prior
    - m_default_hit_prob

- EllipsoidModelSim
  - calcEllipsoidIntersections
    gets used in hit prob calc.
    - m_max_maha_dist_for_hit
      could be opened up for optim.
